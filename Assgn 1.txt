1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
&#39;hello&#39;
-87.8
-
/
+
6
Ans. Here are the values and expressions in the given elements:

* - expression (multiplication operator)
'hello' - value (string)
-87.8 - value (float)
- - expression (subtraction operator)
/ - expression (division operator)
+ - expression (addition operator)
6 - value (integer)

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans. A Variable is a store of information, and a String is a type of information you would store in a Variable. A String is usually words, enclosed with "" Eg String x ="Welcome to SoloLearn" X is the Variable, and we declared it as a String, use the single = to assign the text to it.

3. Describe three different data types.
Ans. 1. Numeric Data Type
Python numeric data type is used to hold numeric values like;

int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
long- holds long integers(exists in Python 2.x, deprecated in Python 3.x).
float- holds floating precision numbers and itâ€™s accurate up to 15 decimal places.
complex- holds complex numbers.
#create a variable with integer value.
a=100
print("The type of variable having value", a, " is ", type(a))

#create a variable with float value.
b=10.2345
print("The type of variable having value", b, " is ", type(b))

#create a variable with complex value.
c=100+3j
print("The type of variable having value", c, " is ", type(c))

 2. String Data Type
The string is a sequence of characters. Python supports Unicode characters. Generally, strings are represented by either single or double-quotes.

a = "string in a double quote"
b= 'string in a single quote'
print(a)
print(b)

# using ',' to concatenate the two or several strings
print(a,"concatenated with",b)

#using '+' to concate the two or several strings
print(a+" concated with "+b)

3.  List Data Type
The list is a versatile data type exclusive in Python.list is an ordered sequence of some data written using square brackets([]) and commas(,).
#list of having only integers
a= [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(a)

#list of having only strings
b=["hello","john","reese"]
print(b)

#list of having both integers and strings
c= ["hey","you",1,2,3,"go"]
print(c)

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Ans. A statement in Python is not evaluated for some results. An expression in Python is evaluated for some results. The execution of a statement changes the state of the variable. The expression evaluation does not result in any state change.


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon    contain?
 bacon = 22
 bacon + 1
Ans: 
 bacon = 22
 bacon + 1
Output : 23
 
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Ans.:'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spamspamspam'

'spam' * 3
'spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans: eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid Because variable names cannot begin with a number.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans. The int() , float() , and str( ) functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten '+ 99 + 'burritos'.
Ans. This expression couse an error becouse we can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. Yes we fix it to convert int to str..
'I have eaten '+ ' 99 '+ 'burritos.'
Output:I have eaten 99 burritos.
