1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans. The two value of Boolean Data Type is True and False.We can use this function to      convert other type values to bool type .
   E.g bool(0) --> False
       bool(1) --> True

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. There are three logical operators that are used to compare values. They evaluate expressions down to Boolean values, returning either True or False . These operators are and , or , and not .

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans. here are the truth tables for the four basic Boolean operators:

AND Operator (&&):

A	B	A && B
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1
OR Operator (||):

A	B	A || B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	1
NOT Operator (!):

A	!A
0	1
1	0
XOR Operator (^):

A	B	A ^ B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
In the tables above, A and B are the two operands that can take on the values of either 0 (false) or 1 (true). The result of the operator is shown in the third column, which evaluates to 0 (false) or 1 (true) depending on the values of A and B.

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
Ans. False
not (5 > 4)
Ans. False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
Ans. True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
Ans. False
(True and True) and (True == False)
Ans. False
(not False) or (not True)
Ans. True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans. There are six comparison operators in Python, which are used to compare two values and return a Boolean (True or False) based on the result of the comparison. The six comparison operators are:

Equal to (==): This operator returns True if the values on both sides of the operator are equal, and False otherwise.

Not equal to (!=): This operator returns True if the values on both sides of the operator are not equal, and False otherwise.

Greater than (>): This operator returns True if the value on the left side of the operator is greater than the value on the right side, and False otherwise.

Less than (<): This operator returns True if the value on the left side of the operator is less than the value on the right side, and False otherwise.

Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator returns True if the value on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the value on the right side, and False otherwise.

Less than or equal to (<=): This operator returns True if the value on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the value on the right side, and False otherwise.

For example, the expression "2 > 1" will evaluate to True because 2 is greater than 1, whereas "3 < 2" will evaluate to False because 3 is not less than 2. 

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans. The equal to operator "==" is a comparison operator used to check if two values are equal, while the assignment operator "=" is used to assign a value to a variable. The two operators are different in that the equal to operator compares two values and returns a Boolean (True or False) indicating if they are equal, while the assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
x = 5     # Assignment operator assigns the value 5 to the variable x
y = 10    # Assignment operator assigns the value 10 to the variable y
result = x == y   # Equal to operator compares the values of x and y and assigns the result to the variable result.
In the code above, the assignment operator is used to assign the values 5 and 10 to the variables x and y, respectively. The equal to operator is then used to compare the values of x and y, and the result of the comparison is assigned to the variable result.

A condition where you might use the equal to operator is when you want to compare two values to see if they are equal, for example:

x = 5
if x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
In the code above, the if statement checks if the value of x is equal to 5 using the equal to operator, and if it is, the message "x is equal to 5" is printed.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Ans. Block 1
     spam = 0  
#This block initializes the variable spam to the value 0.
     Block 2
     if spam == 10:
         print('eggs')
     if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
     else:
        print('ham')
      Block 3
     print('spam')
     print('spam')
#This block consists of two print statements that print the string 'spam' twice. These statements will be executed regardless of the conditional statements in Block 2.

     
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans. 
     spam = 0

     if spam == 1:
         print('Hello')
     elif spam == 2:
         print('Howdy')
     else:
         print('Greetings!')

 Output : Greetings!
 
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans. can use the Ctrl + C key combination to break out of an infinite loop that is causing your program to become unresponsive.
When you press Ctrl + C, a KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised, which you can catch using a try-except block to gracefully terminate the program. For example:

python
Copy code
try:
    while True:
        # code that causes an infinite loop
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('Program terminated.')

In this code, the while loop runs indefinitely until a KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised by the Ctrl + C key combination. The except block catches the exception and executes the code to print a message indicating that the program has been terminated.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans.break and continue are two control statements in Python that can be used to alter the flow of a loop.
Break statement is used to terminate a loop prematurely. When a break statement is encountered in a loop, the loop is immediately terminated, and the program control moves to the next statement after the loop. For example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(i)
Output:-
1
2
3
continue statement, on the other hand, is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. When a continue statement is encountered in a loop, the program control immediately jumps to the next iteration of the loop. For example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
Output:-
1
2
4
5


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans. range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers that can be used to iterate over in a loop.

range(10) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (inclusive), with a step size of 1. This means that the sequence contains 10 elements, from 0 to 9. The syntax for this is: range(stop).

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
range(0, 10) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (inclusive), with a step size of 1. This is the same as range(10). The syntax for this is: range(start, stop).

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)

Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

range(0, 10, 1) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 9 (inclusive), with a step size of 1. This is the same as range(0, 10). The syntax for this is: range(start, stop, step).

for i in range(0, 10, 1):
    print(i)
Output:-
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

In summary, all three range functions generate the same sequence of numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, with a step size of 1. The only difference is in how the arguments are specified.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans.Here is a short Python program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop:
 for i in range(1,11):
     print(i)
Output:-
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Here is an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop:
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
Output:-
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans. If we had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, we can call it after importing spam using the dot notation to access the function:

import spam
spam.bacon()
